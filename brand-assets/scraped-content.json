          "What started as a dream to create something different — an environment where beginners feel supported and experienced grapplers stay challenged — has grown into one of the most exciting academies in the San Fernando Valley.",
          "Before founding New Ground, Coach Lobes spent years immersed in MMA and Jiu Jitsu, coaching at a well-known local academy in the Valley. His deep passion for teaching and the 10th Planet system led him to pursue plans for opening a 10th Planet location near Thousand Oaks, CA.",
          "But life had other plans.",
          "When those plans fell through, Lobes packed up and moved to Seattle, Washington, with a new goal — to help launch 10th Planet Seattle and train alongside one of the best black belts in the world. Then the pandemic hit, and the world shut down.",
          "Even with gyms closed, the drive to teach never faded. Back in Los Angeles, a former student reached out for private coaching. Training began in a one-bedroom apartment, then moved to a garage, where classes filled faster than space allowed.",
          "In just three months, word spread — and New Ground Jiu Jitsu officially opened its doors on July 1, 2021.",
          "From those humble beginnings, the academy quickly grew into a thriving community built on discipline, respect, and camaraderie.",
          "Today, New Ground Jiu Jitsu stands proudly as part of Jiu Jitsu’s modern resurgence, especially in the No-Gi grappling scene. Every class reflects the same passion that started in that tiny apartment — a dedication to helping students grow both on and off the mats.",
          "Whether you’re a complete beginner or an experienced grappler, New Ground offers a place to challenge yourself, make new connections, and experience the best of No-Gi Jiu Jitsu in a welcoming, ego-free environment.",
