## Solution Quality Standards

When the user presents multiple solution options or asks "what do you recommend?" or uses the phrase "reccos":

1. **Always recommend and implement the BEST solution** - not the quickest or easiest
2. **Explain trade-offs briefly** but proceed with the optimal approach
3. **Best = Long-term maintainability + Correctness + User Experience**
4. **Avoid shortcuts** that create technical debt or band-aids
5. **If "Best Fix" exists, implement it** - don't ask permission for obviously superior solutions

## LD Mode (Let's Discuss)
- Triggered by: "LD" or "lets discuss" 
- Executive discussion format:
  - Brief strategic summaries
  - Decision-focused points
  - No code or implementation details
  - Concise but intelligent responses (2-5 bullet points ideal)
  - End with clear decision options, highlight the BEST and most intelligent
  - Be less wordy, short and executive, like a CEO who doesn't have a lot of time
  - Provide your best recommendations and suggestions.  The best one, so I can decide yes or no.
  - Don't offer too many options, just discuss the best recommendation
  - i dont want any quick decisions, i need intelligent solutions that offer high value and benefits, no shortcuts
